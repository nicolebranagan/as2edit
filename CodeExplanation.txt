The following functions are available for code that runs in rooms and in objects:
void spawnKey(int x, int y)
- Spawn a key at a given x and y coordinate. Plays the "Aspect" chime.
void setFlag(string flag, bool value)
- Sets a boolean flag. Flags are adventure-wide but are reset upon exiting unless they begin with '!".
bool getFlag(string flag)
- Returns a boolean flag. If not yet set, returns "false". Flags that begin with "!" will be preserved across entering and exiting the level.
void overwriteTile(int x, int y, int tile)
- Overwrites the tile at [x,y] with the tile depicted by [tile].
void playSoundEffect(int code)
- Plays a sound effect denoted by code:
 * 0: Aspect
 * 1: Boom
bool anyEnemies()
- Returns true if there are any enemies left in the room.
void clearObjects()
- Removes all objects in the room.
void TextBox(string text)
- Opens a text box with string [text].
void callMethod(string name, string method)
- Causes the javascript code in string [method] to run in an AdventureEntity in the room with that name. (The code must be in a string as it passes through C#, object and room codes are not objects from Javascript's perspective)
void giveWeapon(int code)
- Gives a weapon denoted by the following code:
 * 0: ProjectileWeapon
 * 1: FishWeapon
 * 2: TorchWeapon
 * 3: FireballWeapon
int getPlayerX()
- Returns the player X position, rounded to the nearest tile.
int getPlayerY()
- Returns the player Y position, rounded to the nearest tile.
void setCounter(string, int)
- Set a counter, similar to a flag. Counters are never permanent but there are several special counters. ("_life", "_possibleLife", "_keys", "_goldKeys")
int getCounter(string)
- Get the value of a counter.

Additionally, AdventureEntities can call the following functions:
void setDimensions(int width, int height)
- Allows you to set dimensions different from the default.
void overrideSettings(bool floating, bool solid)
- Allows you to override whether things are 
solid (by default) or floating (not by default)
void move(int x, int y)
- Moves x pixels, y pixels. Ideally, x and y should be multiples of 2. If the object is floating, it will not check if surrounding tiles are solid.
void hurtPlayer()
- Causes the player one point of damage. (1/2 hearts)
void die()
- Kills the AdventureEntity.
void questionBox(string text, string callYes, string callNo)
- Displays a text box with "text", then calls the code in "callYes" if yes is chosen, or "callNo", if no is chosen.
